            The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/En:NeMo-Firefox">Mozilla Suite</a> called m/b (or mozilla/browser). 
            fter it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

            Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by default to defend
            against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element 
            as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to "switch to a different search provider across the entire browser," 
            and a global browser console, a new network monitor among other things.
